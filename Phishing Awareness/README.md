# Uh Oh, I Clicked It! What Now?

## Immediate Actions (First Few Minutes/Hours):

1. **Don't Panic (But Act Fast):**  Stay calm, but act quickly.  Panic can lead to further mistakes.

2. **Change Passwords (ASAP!):** This is the most critical step. Change passwords for *all* accounts where you used the compromised credentials. Prioritize email, banking, social media, and any other sensitive accounts.

3. **Notify Relevant Parties:**

    a. **Bank/Financial Institutions:** Immediately contact your bank or credit card company to report the potential fraud.
    b. **Email Provider:** If your email was compromised, contact your email provider.
    c. **Social Media Platforms:** If a social media account was affected, report it to the platform.
    d. **Employer (If Applicable):** If the phishing attack involved work accounts or sensitive company information, notify the IT or security department immediately.

4. **Scan for Malware:** If the phishing link led to a download, run a full system scan with a reputable antivirus/antimalware program.

5. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Enable 2FA for your accounts to add an extra layer of security.
